# About Me - Verdi Pratama

Hi, My name is Verdi Pratama. I was born from a simple family and I am the first in three siblings, I knew the programming when I was in third-year junior high school, began when I was playing a game at an internet cafe, I was curious how the game could run on a computer? and how to make it? I was browsing on the internet and I found a game discussion forum, from there I got information about the programming, which eventually took me to another forum that contained professional programmers, but on the other hand, it turned out that the forum was also a forum for hackers and the cracker got together.

I started to learn programming, and my first website was an online phishing web game, yes indeed that was a bad thing, it was also because of the knowledge I got was from crackers and hackers, I made a phising web with the lure of free game coins, which asks the user to enter his game username and password, then the data that the user enters will be sent directly to my email, I was very happy there and I studied it even deeper, which eventually led me to do sql injection to sites that vulnerable, however, when I entered vocational highschool, I stopped doing that, and only focused on my studies, during the second year of my voactional high school, my mother bought me a laptop, and I began to explore programming again until now, especially web programming, but I did it for positive thingsell, though I was never as fluent in them.

I also enjoy more general IT things like configuring and running servers, networking devices, and storage stuff.
