# About Me - Verdi Pratama

Hi, My name is Verdi Pratama. I program as a hobby or for small side jobs and love the challenge. I've been programming since 2010 and started with QBasic. Since then I've used C, C++, Java, and finally found my love in C#. I had experience with several other languages as well, though I was never as fluent in them.

I also enjoy more general IT things like configuring and running servers, networking devices, and storage stuff.
